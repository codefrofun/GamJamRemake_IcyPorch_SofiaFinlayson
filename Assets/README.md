Icy Porch is a delivery game, where ou have to help the delivery box reach the front porch!

Lava can hurt you, so jump over it using X!

Use magnets to freeze the box (containing metal inside) and unfreeze it, to strategically traverse through the levels!

You can break gray blocks by jumpping into them!

There will be invisible blocks, so glided through them and you will have a new path to follow!


Good luck on you delivery journey!
